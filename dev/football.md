Undefeated since 2005! The Drexel Football Team is a student-run improv group that performs free improvisational comedy shows for the Drexel community. All members are Drexel students - keep an eye out on social media outlets about shows. We perform both long-form and short-form improv.

Completely free. Completely made up on stage.

We hold auditions twice a year and post about it on social media! We do a minimum of two shows per quarter, work shops, and even guest appearances!
