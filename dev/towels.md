A towel is just about the most massively useful thing a Drexel student can carry. Partly because it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across Lancaster Walk; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Korman Square, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly in Drexel Park; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy Schuylkill River; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it around your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Panhandler of Philadephia (a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can''t see it, it can''t see you â€” daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course you can dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.

More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag discovers that a student has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the student any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have "lost." What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of campus, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.

Hence a phrase which has passed into Drexel slang, as in "Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There''s a frood who really knows where his towel is."
