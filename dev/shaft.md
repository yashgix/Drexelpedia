The Drexel Shaft (or just the shaft) is a term that refers to any event or policy brought about by Drexel that impacts students negatively. The term originates from an old smokestack that used to reside near campus and served as a symbol of student malcontent. The structure was demolished in 2009.

May it rest in peace.
